#Quick description

* It shall contain all the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-projects)
* The aim is not to do them all, jus ttry and do as much as I can on my free time
* freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification may not be worth much for recruiters, but it should be fun for a newbie web developper like me to *try* and complete it
